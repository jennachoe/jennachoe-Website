        </h1>Publicist
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jenna Choe. I am currently an active student in college. I attend UC Riverside, home of Scotty the Bear and a diverse population of students. Prior to attending UC Riverside, I lived in NorCal, where the weather is cool and the culture is slightly different from that of SoCal. For example, people from NorCal don't say y'all when addressing others. But I like the differences between these two parts of California, and in fact appreciate them. Some of my hobbies include learning new languages, playing instruments, cooking, and painting. I can speak three languages, but the third language, Spanish, is something that I am still working on. I hope to travel to Spain in the future, and visit the beautiful cathedral. My favorite season is fall, when the leaves start falling from the trees and it's time to snuggle up under a warm blanket. However, I also like winter, and enjoy walking outside when the beginnings of snowfall start softly falling.  <br><br>

        I have experience in publicizing social and fundraising events. At fundraising events that I participated in, I was involved behind the scenes and up front at the events themselves. I worked with others to detailedly plan fundraisers, and offered my assistance in running tables and keeping an eye on the cashbox while doing transactions. I am skilled in handling various social platforms to suit my clients' needs. There is nothing more that I enjoy than facilitating new relationships through the wonderful world of social media. I believe that social media can connect us in unbelievable ways if we allow them to. I take pride in my work, and always do my best to deliver the best quality of work possible. <br><br>

        I also have experience in the customer service industry and have actively participated in volunteer organizations and clubs in the past. I served as a district representative for a volunteer club, and attended board meetings where I actively recorded crucial information and related it back to my home club. I introduced new opportunities and events to my fellow club members. At an after-school program, I worked with young students during homework time and guided them through questions by carefully explaining the steps to finding the solution. I watched over students during recreational time, and made sure that students were safe and harmonious in their playing. A job experience that I had was as a barista during a summer in high school. I worked at a tea and coffee shop, and maintained the cash register while making sure to keep the shop clean and organized. I divided up the work with my coworkers to make sure that the daily operation of the shop ran smoothly. This experience as a cashier and barista taught me much about interacting with customers and finishing things on time. My past activities have allowed me to improve my social, management, and leadership skills. I am a hard worker, but I also do my best to be a smart worker. I can adapt easily as a result of having moved a lot as a kid, and am eager to undergo new enriching experiences that will teach me many good lessons.
